**Code:** [Look Over Here! Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ahourani2000/Data-Scientist-Portfolio/blob/main/MS%20Technical%20Paper.ipynb)

**Technical Paper:** [Look Over Here!](Final_MS_Technical_Paper.pdf)

**Goal:** 
- Analyze human gaze patterns for video game performance using the Atari Eye-tracking dataset that featured 16 different Atari games.

**Objectives:** 
- Explore the correlation between gaze data and game performance.
- Leverage feature engineering and Gaussian Mixture Model to build clusters.
- Visualize differences in gaze patterns between skilled and less-skilled players.

**Tools & Technologies:** 
- *Python*: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, GMM.
- *Jupyter Notebook*: Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, exploration.
- *Dataset*: [Atari-HEAD: Atari Human Eye-Tracking and Demonstration Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3451402)

**Results:** 
- Achieved silhouette scores ranging from 0.35 to 0.55, suggesting significant correlation between gaze pattern and game performance.
